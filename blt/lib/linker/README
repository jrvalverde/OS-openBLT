BLT Dynamic Linker Documentation
--------------------------------

The dynamic linker currently only supports ELF executables.  The linker
itself must be compiled as a static ELF executable.

Any votes for COFF support?

Symbols defined in here should be in the _dl_ namespace (e.g.
_dl_patchup), as ANSI says that user programs shouldn't redefine any
of those.
